                                            Having the website blues? Your site styling burning everyone’s eyes? I personally ran into these issues since
                                            I am a programmer at heart. Not so much an artist or a designer. One day explaining my problems to a web designer
                                            he told me about a few good tools to make a guaranteed professional looking website. The first and most powerful tool is
                                            BootStrap. The main website has great tutorials on how to use the CSS code. If you are struggling with understanding how
                                            to do certain things on a website W3schools is a great source. W3schools explains all the resources needed to create
                                            and host a website. From making a professional basic splash page, to making it interactive, and finally hosting the page
                                            on a server. Even though W3schools gives you everything you need to build a website I personally find that I should flush
                                            out the basics for things like generic images.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Once getting the style, format, and layout of the site done many people turn their attention towards images. That is where
                                            Font Awesome comes into play. Font Awesome focuses on producing generic images that anyone can use. For instance if you are
                                            linking to twitter but want the twitter image to be easily scalable and a different color then you can add the Font Awesome
                                            reference and add the links to that image. The images are extremely easy to find by going to their website and using the
                                            search bar. Plus there are instructions to use all images for Font Awesome. We only have one glaring issue after making
                                            our webpage that is currently offline before we can/should bring it online. We need to add functionality.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If you get all the styling, images, and formatting done for your webpage you have made what designers call a splash page.
                                            It simply means the webpage shows information but can do nothing else. Well, what happens if you want to make a search bar
                                            for your site, or create a web builder, or a blog poster. Angular.js is one of many Java Scripting add-ons that makes coding
                                            a lot simpler. Javascript is what allows your website to actively get edited. That way you can make a format like the
                                            comments on a youtube video, but instead of custom coding every comment for every video Javascript can edit your code to not
                                            only add that comment into a file, but also reference that file and add all comments for the video while using your template.
                                            That way you can make a full working site that also changes itself to what the user desires.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Using all these resources should allow you to easily build a professional webpage that is fully customizable. Though there
                                            will always be the caveat that googling for a specific thing like a search bar in Angular.js, but at  least now you know
                                            what to search for and the full basics to creating a webpage without needing to use a web builder. Which will allways be more
                                            customizable and cheaper if you do it yourself.
                                        </p>

                                            Let me tell you a little about Khan Academy and how it had helped me.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Khan Academy is one of the best resources with which to supplement your knowledge of a multitude of subjects. It is no replacement
                                            for a good teacher, but if you use it to supplement what you have learned in a classroom, you will find your understanding of a
                                            subject will improve in leaps and bounds.
                                        </p>
                                        My personal experience of Khan Academy stems from the help I got in chemistry. When I first started on the subject I struggled with the
                                        concepts. My teacher did what he could but I just couldn't get it. Fortunately my mother had recently heard about Khan Academy and
                                        recommended it to me. It didn’t take me long to get into the material and soon I actually started to enjoy it.
                                        <p>
                                            Since I was starting to like my chemistry class, I decided to continue with it for at least another semester. I ended up using Khan
                                            Academy for the second semester of general chemistry and then continued on through a year of organic chemistry. At this point I
                                            have had enough practice practise so that I am able to understand new material without much extra help. This is rather fortunate
                                            since Khan Academy does not have any material passed organic chemistry and can no longer help me, at least in this subject.
                                        </p>
                                        Khan Academy began with one man tutoring his cousin in math. When scheduling became an issue he started making videos and posting
                                        them on YouTube. Now it is a large organization that has lessons in math, science, computer programing, history, economics and more.
                                        Students can not only watch lessons, they can also solve problems and take quizzes to test their understanding. Those who have an
                                        account will be able to track their progress. Khan Academy has repeatedly shown itself to be a useful resource in learning a variety
                                        of subjects.
                                        <p>
                                            If you are going to use Khan Academy you have to keep in mind that it is not a replacement for a good teacher. It can teach
                                            you rote skills, but students need more than just that to really learn a subject. Many people believe that Khan Academy is
                                            revolutionising the way things are taught. In reality it is not that different from the teaching methods students have seen for
                                            generations. It has a do this then this approach. That being said, Khan Academy excels as a supplementary resource to improve your
                                            understanding of what you have already learned.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Khan Academy helped me understand a subject I was struggling with. Without it I may never have learned to love chemistry. It
                                            helped me in a way that my teacher could not and while it may not be perfect, it is still a resource that I and millions of
                                            others have found to be incredibly useful.

                                            <p>
                                                I just got out of a job interview and a question was asked: “What Languages do you know?”.
                                                Well that's when I started getting flashbacks on trying to pick up languages. I would learn languages like ACL2, CSS, C++, Python,
                                                ect... Some of those languages were similar in syntax, but others look vastly different. So I wanted to make a few things to pick up
                                                on in order to start using a language.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                1. Look at the language purpose
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                At first it may seem strange to look at the intent. With languages like CSS, HTML, and ACL2 we start to see the
                                                importance of for this. For example ACL2 was made to emulate mathematical proofs and theories. This means ACL2 only
                                                loops recursively (by calling the same function) instead of iteratively (while loop), plus there is no way to input information.
                                                Thus if you are trying to input something instead of looking about the internet for a few hours, you can immediately know that it is
                                                impossible in ACL2. Whereas you might be able to know that Java uses inputs and may recommend it as a different language to use.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                2. Look at the language structures
                                            </p>

                                                Understanding if a language has if statements or while loops is a start, but it is also nice to understand how to enter the structures
                                                into the computer. Sites like stackoverflow and w3schools play a major role in this step. Most languages do have documentation so I
                                                personally follow an old teachers advice and google something like Java Loops or C++ documentation if it is not found on our site and
                                                then let us know so we can check it out and perhaps add the site to our lists.

                                                3. Look at declarations

                                                Languages also have different ways to make variables. Python just uses var in front of a name, but Java and C++ makes you pick a
                                                variable type (Strings, Doubles, Boolean, ect...) you want to use. This site will include many documentation sources, but as for
                                                the amount of languages there are you may have to just google it and let us know what you found so we can check it out and perhaps
                                                add it to our list.
                                            </p>

                                                At first remembering so many languages does seem challenging and tedious, but remember it gets easier every language you know. Cause
                                                perhaps your getting an interview and they would like a candidate who knows a certain set of languages or a candidate who can recommend
                                                a few languages for the given project.

                                                When I first began college I was rather prideful of my knowledge and didn't utilize all the resources I had available to me. Tutors are one
                                                of these resource and are probably one of the more important ones. A good tutor is able to teach you even when your teacher can not. Using
                                                this resource can be the difference between a pass and a fail.

                                            <p>
                                                <b>
                                                    My pride worked against me
                                                </b>

                                            <p>
                                                For all of highschool I was the smart one. I never needed help with my homework and even when I didn't do it I could still ace my tests.
                                                The ease I had with highschool ment I never learned proper studying habits. After graduation I was confident that college would be the same
                                                and that first semester I didn't take it seriously. Boy was I in for a shock when I started struggling with my course load. I couldn’t keep
                                                up and never once thought about getting some help.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                After the first semester my confidence was shot an I transferred to a smaller school. My second school was Central Wyoming College. I spent
                                                a year there before deciding I wasn’t ready for college and decided I need time off to get my head in order. It was six years before I
                                                returned. That is when I consider my college education to have really begun.

                                                    Why tutors help
                                                </b>

                                            <p>
                                                I never took advantage of tutors myself as I found that I didn’t need them after my discovery of Khan Academy. However I have talked to other students
                                                who have utilized tutors and I have done some tutoring myself. I have to say that if I had used tutors myself I would have had a much easier time that first semester.
                                                Sometimes you need a little extra help understanding course material and a tutor can be an enormous help. There's a few things that make tutors so helpful
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Tutors can provide one on one help and adapt their teaching methods to you.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Tutors can provide encouragement. It is far more fun to learn when you have someone on your side to keep you going.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Self paced learning. Teachers have to cater to a large number of students and can’t slow down for just one. With a tutor you can control the pace.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Tutors can help you create good study habits. This is something that you will use for the rest of your life.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Sometimes it is hard to ask questions in front of your peers. A tutor can allow you to ask those questions without pressure.
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                If you are struggling with any of your courses then I can not stress enough the importance of getting help. It is not shameful to need help and having a
                                                tutor does not mean you are stupid. I made this mistake in my first semester and it took me six years to get back on track. I may be a more extreme case,
                                                but please learn from my mistakes.
                                            </p>
